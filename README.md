## Description <a name='description'></a>
In this project, I was asked to complete a day planner using Javascript to dynamically generate an HTML document. Developing this website required researching Moments.js, DOM traversal methods, Bootstrap, and JQuery. Due to the lack of a database, local storage was used to save persistent data on this application.

## Installation <a name='installation'></a>
This application doesn't have any installation instructions.

## Usage <a name='usage'></a>
Live Website: https://alexisgonzalez07.github.io/SingleDayPlanner/

This product can be used as to log and track dailty tasks. Tasks can be saved, updated, or removed by interacting with the text area and pressing the save button. This overrides local storage, so once a task is overwritten, it can't be recovered. Additionally, tasks in the past are highlited in red, and those in the future in gree.


## Testing <a name='testing'></a>
This application has no tests.

## Contribution <a name='contribution'></a>
The project is expected to be expanded upon following the graduation of the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin in December of 2021.
